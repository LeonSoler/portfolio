Today I work as a fullstack developer, with special interest in smooth, well-thought mobile applications.",
        "p2": "In my day-to-day, I use Linux because I like having total control over my development environment (and honestly, almost anything is better than Windows). I'm passionate about creating software that's useful, maintainable, and doesn't make users suffer.",
        "p3": "Outside of code, I love animals —I have a calico cat named Graciela who thinks she owns the keyboard— and movies. Quentin Tarantino is my favorite director and Kill Bill is my all-time favorite movie.",
        "p4": "I describe myself as an old soul: I prefer steady, well-done work over unnecessary rush. As Uncle Bob says: <em>\"The only way to go fast, is to go well.\"</em> I enjoy collaborating in teams, teaching what I know, and learning from others. I always seek simple solutions to complex problems, because elegance tends to be the most effective.",
