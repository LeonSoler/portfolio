# 🚀 León's Portfolio (The "It Works on My Machine" Edition)

Welcome to the digital manifestation of my coffee addiction. This is my portfolio, built with **Next.js**, **React**, and a questionable amount of **Stack Overflow** copy-pasting.

## 🧐 What is this?
It's a website. It shows people that I know how to center a `<div>` (sometimes) and that I can type obscure commands into a terminal until green text appears.

It supports **English** and **Spanish**, because sounding confused in just one language wasn't enough.

## 🛠️ The "Tech Stack" (aka "Things I installed via npm and prayed didn't break")
- **Next.js 16**: Because I like living on the bleeding edge (and by bleeding, I mean debugging breaking changes).
- **TypeScript**: Because `any` is a valid type if you're brave enough. (Just kidding, I actually used types... mostly).
- **Tailwind CSS**: Because writing real CSS is so 2015.
- **Next-Intl**: For translating "Hello" to "Hola" without rewriting the entire codebase.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run This Beast

### Prerequisites
- A computer (optional, but recommended).
- **Node.js**: New enough to not complain, old enough to be stable.
- **Yarn**: Because `npm` is for mortals.

### Installation
1.  Clone this repo (and star it, or my self-esteem will crash):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/leonsoler/portfolio.git
    cd portfolio
    ```

2.  Install dependencies (this is the part where you go get a coffee):
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. If it doesn't load, try turning it off and on again.

## 🚢 Deployment
Run `yarn build` to generate the static files. It uses `output: 'export'`, which means no servers were harmed in the making of this deployment.

## 🐛 Bugs
There are no bugs, only *unexpected features*.
But if you find one, feel free to open an issue (I promise to look at it... eventually).

## 📄 License
Licensed under the **MIT License**. That means you can steal this code, but if your computer explodes, don't blame me.
